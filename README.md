# Selenium Tutorial

A sample Selenium project for reference.

## Highlights

The codebase emphasises on writing generic code which can be bootstrapped with `Chrome` or `Firefox` on demand. Also demonstrated is a way of writing generic functions for simplifying code, improving readability and reuse.

## Usage

```
java -jar file.jar <browsers>
```

You can specify either or both `chrome` and `firefox` as command line parameters which would then run the written tests on the specified browsers.
